# quizzler

A new Flutter application that gives you certain quiz questions which are marked correct or incorrect by the application. 

You can see the number of right and wrong questions at the end of your quiz.

It has a total of 13 questions, and works in the form of a true-false quiz. 
If you tap on the correct answer, you get a green tick dispalyed at the bottom of the screen.
If you select the wrong answer, a red cross is dispalyed.
